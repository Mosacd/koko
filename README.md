## 💡 What is Koko?

Koko is named after the world-famous gorilla who learned sign language — a symbol of empathy, intelligence, and non-verbal connection.  
Our app aims to **celebrate and teach sign language** to bridge communication gaps and build a more inclusive future.

Koko is not just a tool. It's the start of a **movement** — where anyone, anywhere, can learn to communicate beyond words.
